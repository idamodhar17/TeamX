## About Project 
This is an AI-driven general disease diagnosis project where we have train the ML model which can predict general diease of some one by taking some input values from the user side.
AI-driven general disease diagnosis has the potential to revolutionize healthcare by enabling quicker, more accurate, and data-informed diagnostics. In this hackathon, participants are encouraged to create AI tools that assist in identifying a wide range of diseases, using data sources such as medical images, lab results, and patient records. By leveraging machine learning for predictive modeling and pattern recognition, these solutions aim to support healthcare providers in making precise diagnoses more efficiently. The outcome can help reduce diagnostic errors, optimize clinician workflows, and improve access to timely care, especially in resource-constrained settings.
